"""FinHub — the front end for the CJTrade trading engine.

Three things the UI needs and three sources for them, each the only one that
can answer its own questions:

    engine  (:8898, read-only)  what the bots are doing right now
    broker  (:8802)             the account, the orders, the market
    FinHub's own DB             that a run happened, and who placed what by hand

Every one of those calls is made here, server-side. The browser talks only to
FinHub — see cjtrade/__init__.py for why that is the whole design and not a
detail.

    Off means two things and both of them matter:

    The second is the point. Whoever presses this during a paper or real run
    has just found a problem, and "it will not be in the next run" is not an
    answer to that. The engine grew a control plane for it.

    Stopping is not flattening. The bot places no more orders and its resting
    orders are pulled back, and the position it already holds is left exactly
    where it is -- selling it would be a second decision, made at whatever
    price happens to be there, and nobody asked for that by switching a
    strategy off.

    Switching it back on does NOT restart a bot mid-run. The engine builds its
    roster when a run starts, so a re-enabled strategy joins the next one.
