"""Client for the trading engine's read-only status API.

Mirrors `poc/trading_engine/status_api.py`. Everything here is a GET; the
engine exposes no write surface and this client must not grow one — the
engine's control path is its ZMQ intent socket, and a run is started and
stopped through `RunSupervisor`, not over HTTP.

"The engine is not running" is the normal case, not an error: most of the time
there is no run in flight. So the methods raise one specific exception for it
and the routes turn that into a quiet "no run" rather than a 500.
