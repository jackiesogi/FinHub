"""What FinHub itself stores.

Deliberately small. FinHub is a front end: the authority on an account is the
broker and the authority on a run in flight is the engine, so copying either
into this database would only create a second answer that can disagree. What
lives here is what nothing else keeps:

* `Run`     -- that a run happened, how it was configured, and how it ended.
              The engine forgets a run the moment its process exits.
* `BotSlot` -- which strategy was asked to run under which bot id.
* `ManualOrder` -- that a human, not a bot, placed this order. The broker
              records the order but not who asked for it, and the engine's
              risk gate never saw it.
* `Strategy` -- source somebody wrote in the editor. Nothing else keeps it:
              the engine is handed a file and forgets it when the run ends.
